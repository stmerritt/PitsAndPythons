# PitsAndPythons

Hello reader,

As a practice of coding and learning the ins and outs of both Python development and GitHub, I started coding a playable Dungeons-And-Dragons-esque game. I own none of the content, all of which has been taken from the rules that I've been able to find from D&D material found online, mainly from the Player's Handbook. I only own the Pyton code that implements the rules, not the rules themselves. Any use of this module for monetary or nefarious gain without the explicit consent of the owners of D&D is likely illegal, so don't do it. This module is intended for fun and for proof of the coding skills of Stephen Merritt only.

Hopefully that covers enough,
Stephen Merritt, Electrical Engineer/Developer
